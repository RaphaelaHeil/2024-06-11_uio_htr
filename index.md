This workshop provides a technical introduction to deep-learning-based handwritten text recognition (HTR). We will begin with a general introduction to the topic and outline a typical HTR pipeline. Afterwards, each pipeline's steps will be discussed in detail, including hands-on exercises using PyTorch.

The presented examples will focus on a handwritten document scenario, however the general pipeline and most of the steps are directly applicable to printed material as well. Differences and possible adaptations will be pointed out along the way.

While transformer-based HTR models are gaining popularity, this workshop will focus on the more classical but still state-of-the-art approach of Connectionist Temporal Classification. The workshop will conclude with thoughts on reproducibility and experiences from training HTR models on computing centre resources.
